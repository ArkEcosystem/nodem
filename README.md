# Nodem

![Nodem](./banner.png)

Nodem is an all-in-one tool for managing your ARK Core-based blockchain nodes with integrations for popular server providers, such as DigitalOcean and Hetzner. Nodem is no longer in development.

## Installation

### Requirements

- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) _(development only)_
- [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/valet) or [Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/homestead) _(development only)_

### Other requirements

The application relies on the `cmd` function that is used to run a `ping` command on the terminal and extract the server response time, this function should work in most cases but there are some considerations to take in mind:

- The `ping` command may not work in Windows-based servers
- Some servers may not have permission to run the PHP `cmd` function.

### Production

Clone the repository and install the dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/nodem.git
cd nodem
composer install --no-dev
```

Configure the environment
> We advise using Redis for cache and queues.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

> Make sure to adjust the `APP_URL` variable in your .env file to reflect the host, e.g the IP address of the server where Nodem runs

```
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1
```

Prepare the application.

This will guide you in generating the invitation code that you need to create your first account (owner).

```bash
php artisan nodem:install
```

Symlink storage directory and start Horizon

```bash
php artisan storage:link
php artisan horizon
```

### Development

Currently, the instructions are for Valet

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/nodem.git
cd nodem
composer install
yarn install

cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

> Make sure to adjust the `APP_URL` variable in your .env file to reflect the host, e.g the IP address of the server where Nodem runs

```
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1
```

php artisan storage:link
composer db:dev # or composer db:bare
yarn run watch

valet link nodem
```

Afterwards, you can navigate to `nodem.test` in your browser to see it in action

#### Two-Factor Authentication

By default, the site will require all logged-in users to have Two-Factor Authentication setup on their account. This can be disabled by adding `TWO_FACTOR_ENABLED=false` to the `.env` file.

#### Custom Dropdown component

There is a dropdown component which is a variation of the UI dropdown component. This incorporates repositioning of dropdown. A copy of the component is kept here as it causes a breaking change across all other projects, along with `:init-alpine="false"` no longer being supported.

## Testing

You can run the unit tests with `php artisan test` or `./vendor/bin/pest`. Check the `phpunit.xml` file for the default settings, as the tests will require a database in order to run. If you end up adjusting the `phpunit.xml` file to run your tests, please ensure that you do not commit those changes.

## Known Limitations

Although Nodem in its current state will work, there are possible improvements to be made over time. These are outlined in the [Known Limitations](KNOW_LIMITATIONS.md) document in this repository and are a good starting point if you are interested in contributing.
